## üìù Description

Welcome to CarePulse! A healthcare management system that streamlines the patient appointment process with real-time SMS notifications.

Healthcare appointments often involve long waiting times and inefficient processes. Patients typically spend hours waiting for their doctor's appointments, creating frustration and wasting valuable time. The existing manual systems lack real-time updates and proper communication channels between healthcare providers and patients.

The mission of the CarePulse project was to create a healthcare management system that streamlines the appointment process and improves communication between patients and healthcare providers.

The application features patient registration, appointment scheduling, and an admin dashboard for managing appointments with real-time SMS notifications.

**Technologies Used:** Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Appwrite, Twilio, Sentry, React Hook Form, Zod

## ‚ú® Features

- **Advanced Form Management System:** Highly reusable form system with custom components for various input types including text fields, phone inputs, date pickers, file uploads, and more. This allows for complex multi-step registration forms while maintaining clean, maintainable code.

- **Real-time SMS Notifications:** SMS notifications using Appwrite and Twilio integration to keep patients informed about their appointment status. When an admin schedules or cancels an appointment, the patient receives an immediate notification with relevant details.

- **Comprehensive Admin Dashboard:** Feature-rich admin dashboard with appointment statistics, a data table for managing appointments, and functionality to schedule or cancel appointments. The dashboard provides a complete overview of all patient appointments with filtering and pagination capabilities.
